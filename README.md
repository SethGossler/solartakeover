# HTML5 with Phaser !

I've built a small framework to help out with this using gulp.

Steps you'll need to do to get this running:

* 1.) Install Node.JS
* 2.) in the root directory, run "npm install". 
* 3.) in the root directory, run "bower install".

After doing those, run the framework by running "gulp". The game will start running on, "localhost:3000"

I've tried to break up Phaser's states into modules. I plan to include a scaffolding system later to help out with module creation, but you should be able to see how they work in src/states/. There's a default state in src, that you can copy.

Gulp allows code to be written, and built automatically. To make a change, just save your code, and refresh your browser. There are libs to refresh the browser on saves ... could include those later

Let me know if you have feedback.
